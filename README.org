* Objective
- poll https://localhost:2999/liveclientdata/ endpoints as required by app config with riotgames root CA cert

- parse and send output to stdout

* Notes

* Tasks
** TODO init repo
- Cargo deps
- tests/
- Makefile
** DONE hack around with Riot Game Client
- rate limit: 20/1s; 100/2m
- curl it boi
- docs [[https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol][Riot Developer Portal]]
*** RESULT: success
- NOT accessible over LAN, only local.
  - np really, ssh and curl for quick tests
  - feel like we should implement a wrapper API anyways - with client/server decoupled
    - future state would likely be a video-stream overlay - most streamers run 2 PCs
    - would be surprised if some dev hasn't already implemented something like this, just maybe not in Rust 8) - will research
    - thinkin without the native limitation is fine for now
- gamedata is NOT spectator-level - local player-level only
  - when p1 buys item outside of enemy p2 vision, p1 json output value updates, p2 json output does not
    - TEST AGAIN with gold values
- we can impl something with [[https://github.com/hatoo/oha][oha]] to validate the rate limits (curious if gamedata limits are different)
  - work in some ssl-fu
- spectator-mode is fully supported with god-mode stats
  - useful for model training, maybe W/L 0.-1
